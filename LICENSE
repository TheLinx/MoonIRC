        MoonIRC - A IRC server powered by Lua!

All the code in the Git repository is Public Domain. This
means that you may use the code however you like; in
proprietary setups, open-source-only setups, and any other
that you may come up with. The authors of MoonIRC will
however appreciate that if you make any changes to the
source code and you believe that other people may find that
functionality useful, please backport it to the main MoonIRC
repo. Also, please leave any version strings as-is, i.e.
don't turn the version string into a user-agent hell.
